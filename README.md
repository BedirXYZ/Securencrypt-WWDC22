# Securencrypt - WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge Submission
## 👀 Overview
### Submission Status: Submitted 📝
My Playground for the WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge! I made this project to inform people about what is encryption and why it is needed.

You can download the project and try it out. And sorry about the comments in my code. I am a little bit lazy person to write comments. But feel free to try it out yourself, tweak the code, and reach out to me with any questions! 😁
